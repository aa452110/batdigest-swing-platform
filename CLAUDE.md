# CLAUDE.md - BatDigest Swing Analysis Coach Platform

## Current Status (Aug 28, 2025)
**WORKING:** Multi-coach system with unique logins and coach-specific video queues. Coaches can sign up, get unique invite codes, and see only their players' submissions.

**NEW (Aug 28, 2025):**
1. **Multi-Coach System** - Each coach has unique login and 6-character invite code
2. **Coach-Specific Queues** - Videos filtered by coach invite code
3. **Reference Video Management** - Coaches can manage their own reference videos (stored in localStorage)
4. **Coach Authentication** - JWT-based auth system with email verification

## Live URLs
- **Production Site:** https://swing.batdigest.com
- **API Endpoint:** https://swing-platform.brianduryea.workers.dev
- **GitHub Repo:** https://github.com/aa452110/batdigest-swing-platform

## Purpose
**Coach-only web app** for baseball swing analysis. Coaches load videos from submission queue, annotate (lines/arrows/boxes), scrub frame-by-frame while **recording voiceover**, create 7-day hitting plans, and export the session as a video for players. **Supported environment:** Chrome on macOS.

## Multi-Coach System

### Coach Registration & Authentication
- **Signup**: `/coach/signup` - Creates account with email, password, name, organization
- **Login**: `/coach/login` - Authenticates and redirects to `/coach/queue`
- **Invite Codes**: Each coach gets a unique 6-character alphanumeric code (e.g., `7JMZJ6`)
- **Test Coach**: 
  - Email: `testcoach@example.com`
  - Password: `TestPassword123!`
  - Invite Code: `7JMZJ6`

### Video Submission Flow
1. **Player enters coach code** in iOS app (optional field)
2. **Video tagged with `coach_code`** in database
3. **Coach sees only their videos** in queue (filtered by invite code)
4. **Unassigned videos** (code `000000`) go to general pool

### Database Schema Updates

#### `coaches` table
```sql
{
  id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  email: TEXT UNIQUE,
  password_hash: TEXT,
  full_name: TEXT,
  organization: TEXT,
  invite_code: TEXT UNIQUE,  -- 6-character code like "7JMZJ6"
  is_verified: INTEGER,       -- Email verification status
  verification_token: TEXT,
  subscription_tier: TEXT DEFAULT 'basic',
  max_players: INTEGER DEFAULT 100,
  created_at: DATETIME
}
```

#### `video_submissions` table (updated)
```sql
{
  id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  submission_id: TEXT UNIQUE,
  user_id: INTEGER,
  r2_key: TEXT,
  video_size: INTEGER,
  athlete_name: TEXT,
  coach_code: TEXT DEFAULT '000000',  -- Links to coach's invite_code

  wants_bat_advice: INTEGER (0/1),
  wants_drills: INTEGER (0/1),
  wants_mechanics: INTEGER (0/1),

```

## Routes & Access

### Admin Routes (`/admin/*`)
- `/admin/queue` - View ALL video submissions (legacy admin view)
- `/admin/analyzer` - Analyze selected video
- `/admin/resource-videos` - Manage reference videos
- Password: `coach500admin`

## Reference Videos System

Coaches can manage their own reference videos, stored in browser localStorage:

### Storage Structure
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('coachReferenceVideos', JSON.stringify([
  { name: 'Pro Swing Example', url: 'blob://...' },
  { name: 'Youth Mechanics', url: 'blob://...' }
]));
```

### Features
- Videos stored locally on coach's machine
- Persists across sessions (until browser data cleared)
- Each coach has their own set of reference videos
- Fallback to default MLB player videos if none added

## Security Notes
- Coach passwords are hashed with bcrypt
- JWT tokens for session management (basic implementation)
- Email verification required for coach accounts
- Video URLs are currently public (no auth on streaming)
- Consider implementing:
  - Token refresh mechanism
  - Rate limiting
  - Secure video streaming

## Quick Start for Coaches

1. **Sign Up**: Navigate to `/coach/signup`
2. **Get Invite Code**: Provided after signup (e.g., `7JMZJ6`)
3. **Share with Players**: Players enter code in iOS app
4. **Login**: `/coach/login` with email/password
5. **View Queue**: See only your players' submissions
6. **Analyze**: Click "Analyze" to review and annotate videos
7. **Manage References**: Add your own reference videos at `/admin/resource-videos`

Remember: The iOS app needs to be updated to include a coach code input field for this system to fully work.
